#### Clone repo and run npm start in root directory of terminal

#### This was the application created along with the Wes Bos React tutorial. The application does the following: 

- Creates a unique store (restaurant) for each user
- Lists a menu for each store which is editable and remains data persistent due to firebase and local storage
- Maintains state across all components allowing user to update all components (order, menu, inventory) in one place

## Technologies Used
- React
- ES6
